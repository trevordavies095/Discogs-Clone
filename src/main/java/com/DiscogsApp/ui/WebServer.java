/**
 * The server that initializes the set of HTTP request handlers.
 * This defines the <em>web application interface</em> for this
 * guessing game application.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are multiple ways in which you can have the client issue a
 * request and the application generate responses to requests. If your team is
 * not careful when designing your approach, you can quickly create a mess
 * where no one can remember how a particular request is issued or the response
 * gets generated. Aim for consistency in your approach for similar
 * activities or requests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Design choices for how the client makes a request include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Request URL</li>
 *   <li>HTTP verb for request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and so on)</li>
 *   <li><em>Optional:</em> Inclusion of request parameters</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design choices for generating a response to a request include:
 * <ul>

 *   <li>View templates with conditional elements</li>
 *   <li>Use different view templates based on results of executing the client request</li>
 *   <li>Redirecting to a different application URL</li>
 * </ul>

    //// Setting any route (or filter) in Spark triggers initialization of the
    //// embedded Jetty web server.

    //// A route is set for a request verb by specifying the path for the
    //// request, and the function callback (request, response) -> {} to
    //// process the request. The order that the routes are defined is
    //// important. The first route (request-path combination) that matches
    //// is the one which is invoked. Additional documentation is at
    //// http://sparkjava.com/documentation.html and in Spark tutorials.

    //// Each route (processing function) will check if the request is valid
    //// from the client that made the request. If it is valid, the route
    //// will extract the relevant data from the request and pass it to the
    //// application object delegated with executing the request. When the
    //// delegate completes execution of the request, the route will create
    //// the parameter map that the response template needs. The data will
    //// either be in the value the delegate returns to the route after
    //// executing the request, or the route will query other application
    //// objects for the data needed.

    //// FreeMarker defines the HTML response using templates. Additional
    //// documentation is at
    //// http://freemarker.org/docs/dgui_quickstart_template.html.
    //// The Spark FreeMarkerEngine lets you pass variable values to the
    //// template via a map. Additional information is in online
    //// tutorials such as
    //// http://benjamindparrish.azurewebsites.net/adding-freemarker-to-java-spark/.

    //// These route definitions are examples. You will define the routes
    //// that are appropriate for the HTTP client interface that you define.
    //// Create separate Route classes to handle each route; this keeps your
    //// code clean; using small classes.
